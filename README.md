# SpriteKit_Planets
SpriteKit of Rudimentary planet motion.  
As of May 5, trajectory of is theoretically following a model, but the time dependence is absent(to do)

November 2021 I added the time dependence calculation using interpolation of angular momenta based on kepler's Law.
There is also an eccentricity slider, so you can see how the eccentricity changes the behavior of the orbit on the fly!
